>**Description** -> 

>>These graphs shows the % change in value within a week and 24 hours period. Using these graphs one can gain an insight on which coins dropped and climbed within 24 hrs and 7 days period.

>**Analysis** -> 

>> According to the data, the worst performers in 24 hr period were Flappy coin, Credence-coin, Coupe-coin, Tyro-coin and more, these coins had the highest % negative change (decrease) in value 

>>While on the other hand, The best performers in 24 hr race were Fedoracoin, Cashcoin and Bitzeny. Any day time trader betting on these few coins would gain the highest profits off of their tra

>> Looking at the worst and best performers in a 1 week period, a new contestent is introduced in the losing race, Royalties, dropping by -100% of its value, meaning, anyone owning Royalties coins lost all their capital in 7 days. Flappy coin and credence still held on to thier position in being the worst performing coins in a week.

>> There is a big change change in top performerming coins in one week from those of 24 hrs with an exception of Bitzeny. Bitzeny increased by 3360% within a week. To put into context, anyone investing 1000$ in Bitzeny would gain 3,000,000$ at the end of the week, a millionaire within a week period!!!

### Graph 3- How coins are spread out in the market 

>**Description** -> 

>>The graph beautifully shows how the coins are spread out in the market based on their capitalization brackets.

>> HERE
>>>  GOLDEN LEAGUE =  coins having marketcap greater than 5 billion

>>> BIG LEAGUE = coins having marketcap greater than 600 million but smaller than 5 billion

>>> MID LEAGUE = coins having marketcap greater than 100 million but smaller than 600 million 

>>> BRONZE LEAGUE = coins having marketcap less than 100 million


>**Analysis** -> 

>> According the Graph, only 7 coins had Market_cap greater than 5 billion USD, which is 0.63% of total circulating coins

>> Bronze league had the highest number of coins, which are the coins with value less than a 100 million, consisting of 943 coins, ~91% of the coins in entire crypto market fall in this bracket

#### According to my analysis, the coins with capital less than 100 million USD have the highest % change in their value, they can be the best horse to bet on or a black hole that will vaccum your funds in a single day.

#### Coins having highest % capitalization are least volatile and can be the best means of investment.
